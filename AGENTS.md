# AGENTS.md

Gradient is a local-first daily planner: Electron, React 19, one Loro CRDT document per workspace,
Zod-validated records, Tailwind v4 with Radix primitives. This file is the entry point for AI agents
and the short version for humans.

Read [docs/reference/conventions.md](docs/reference/conventions.md) before writing code and
[docs/reference/architecture.md](docs/reference/architecture.md) before changing the document layer.

## Stack

- pnpm workspaces, no Turborepo (ADR-0012).
- Desktop: Electron + electron-vite, React 19, TypeScript strict, Tailwind CSS v4, Radix primitives,
  Zustand for UI state.
- Document: Loro CRDT, Zod schema, `WorkspaceDocument` as the only writer.
- Notes: a Loro text container today; the Tiptap binding lands with the task editor.
- Quality: Biome, Vitest + Testing Library, Storybook with a11y, Playwright for Electron smoke.

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev          # Electron + Vite renderer
pnpm check        # biome, tsc, vitest --changed, shape
pnpm verify       # lint, typecheck, all tests, shape, knip, build, storybook build
pnpm test         # every Vitest project
pnpm storybook    # component workshop
pnpm e2e:smoke    # Playwright Electron journey, on request only
pnpm package      # electron-builder for this platform
```

## Verify

The gate is local and runs on every change:

```sh
pnpm lint && pnpm typecheck && pnpm test && pnpm shape
```

`pnpm check` is the edit loop: Biome, `tsc` across the workspace, `vitest run --changed`, and the
shape check. `pnpm verify` adds `knip`, the production build and the Storybook build.

Playwright sits outside both. Run `pnpm e2e:smoke` when the owner asks for it or names a milestone;
no change waits on it.

All verification gates are local. Every gate claim names a local command.

## Rules

1. Document data goes through `@gradient/core` (`WorkspaceDocument`). Never touch Loro from a
   component, and never import `loro-crdt` outside `packages/core/src/loro`.
2. Document truth never lives in Zustand, React state or localStorage. Zustand holds UI state only.
3. Validate every write with the Zod schema. A write sets the leaf keys that changed, never the whole
   record.
4. TypeScript stays strict. No `any` without a justified `biome-ignore`; prefer `unknown` and
   narrowing.
5. Renderer talks to the machine only through `GradientBridge`; every IPC payload is validated in
   main.
6. The renderer is sandboxed: `contextIsolation`, `sandbox`, no `nodeIntegration`, no remote content.
7. Conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
8. No new dependency without a stated job and the right package.
9. Docs change with the code they describe. A decision that changes the shape gets an ADR.
10. Keep the renderer accessible: Radix primitive first, labelled controls, visible focus, no
    colour-only state.

## Code shape

Pure core, imperative shell. Schema, projections (`dayPlan`, `capacityFor`, `occurrencesBetween`),
sorting and the capture parser take data and return data: no DOM, no Loro, no `fetch`, no timers.
`WorkspaceDocument`, the file store, the scheduler, IPC handlers and React hosts own state and I/O.
Dependencies point inward.

One owner per piece of state: document truth in Loro through `WorkspaceDocument`, UI state in
Zustand, transient view state in React.

`neverthrow` `Result` belongs at fallible boundaries: file decode, validation, IPC parsing.

## Feature path

1. Model it in `packages/core/src/schema.ts` with tests.
2. Add a typed accessor or mutation on `WorkspaceDocument`.
3. Consume it through `useWorkspaceSnapshot` and the Zustand store.
4. Add a story where it is visual, a test where behaviour is non-trivial.
5. Update the reference docs and run `pnpm check`.

## Definition of done

Schema and types in `@gradient/core` with unit tests; a component test or story where the change is
visible; docs updated in the same change; `pnpm verify` green; no new `any`, no raw Loro writes, no
document state in the UI store.

## Tools for the session

`.mcp.json` and `.vscode/mcp.json` are empty on purpose. Add a server only for a task that needs it,
and name its tools explicitly. Never use `"*"`: an unlisted surface costs context and hides which
tools actually ran.

## Decision records

`docs/adr/` holds our own records, starting at ADR-0001. They are written for Gradient; none are
copied from another project. A comment may cite `ADR-NNNN`, and the surrounding prose should still
state the decision so the code does not depend on opening the file.
